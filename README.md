An approach to some of the Foobar Questions

## What is Google Foobar?
The Google Foobar is an interesting secret-hiring challenge started by Google in the year 2014. Well whether or not Google still uses it to hire people be a question of uncertainity, it is for sure that it indeed is a very challenging ride from the moment you start it, and can take a while for you to complete it. There a total of 5 levels, where you get 1, 2 or 3 questions depending on the level, and you get increasing amount of time to solve as you climb up the ladder. 

## Levels of Foobar
As already mentioned, there are a total of 5 levels, with an increasing difficulty level, ie. Level 1 being the easiest and Level 5 being the toughest.

## Questions that came
Some of the very interesting problems that I encountered and have been discussed in this repository are as follows:

### Level 1
1. I Love Lance and Janice
### Level 2
1. 
2.
### Level 3
1. Doomsday Fuel
2. Prepare the Bunnies Escape
3. 
### Level 4
1. 

Although I I was never able to go beyond Level 4 Question 2, I sincerely hope you do, and get a chance to be interviewed by Google! Happy Learning :)
